My name is Jiansen Song (宋建森 in Chinese). I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. student of Technology Center of Software Engineering ([TCSE](http://www.tcse.cn/)) at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://www.is.cas.cn/)). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wensheng Dou](http://www.tcse.cn/~wsdou/), Prof. [Jun Wei](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~weijun) and Prof. [Wei Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~iscaswangwei).

I am interested in distributed databases. More recently, I focus on testing the reliability of relational databases via fuzzing.
